## Our Goal

The goal is to understand how to save data in iOS and look at various choices and learn to use UserDefaults, Core Data and Realm.


## What we will create

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks

## Dependencies Used
* RealmSwift - Realm is a cross platform mobile database for iOS (available in Swift & Objective-C) and Android. Realm is built to be better and faster than SQLite and Core Data. It is not just better or faster, it's also easier to use and you can do a lot of things with just few lines of code.

* SwipeCellKit - A swipeable `UITableViewCell` or `UICollectionViewCell` with support for:

Left and right swipe actions
Action buttons with: *text only, text + image, image only*
Haptic Feedback
Customizable transitions: *Border, Drag, and Reveal*
Customizable action button behavior during swipe
Animated expansion when dragging past threshold
Customizable expansion animations
Support for both `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`
Accessibility
Dark Mode

* ChameleonFramework/Swift - Chameleon is a lightweight, yet powerful, color framework for iOS (Objective-C & Swift). It is built on the idea that software applications should function effortlessly while simultaneously maintaining their beautiful interfaces.

With Chameleon, you can easily stop tinkering with RGB values, wasting hours figuring out the right color combinations to use in your app, and worrying about whether your text will be readable on the various background colors of your app.
